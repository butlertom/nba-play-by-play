# NBA Play-by-Play Data

Taking play-by-play data and applying data science and machine learning techniques to derive insight from it.

Some high level ideas to start:
* predicting the final score of the game
* predicting the winner of the game based on different amounts of time remaining
* extract a box score from the game
* training a language model on the plays, as a transformer, and then using that to predict something?
